# The CEO of SmartCompany gets excited with BYOR app and decides to use it at the SmartCompany
This spec describes a way the BYOR can be used in a Company.
This spec aims to specify and test only the APIs provided by the back end.

It uses guage with Typescript with the support of the following package
https://bugdiver.dev/gauge-ts/#/


One evenening, the CEO of the SmartCompany attended at a presentation of the BYOR application and decided to try
it at SmartCompany itself.

The morning after the CEO called the Rebecca, the chief architect, told her about the BYOR and got her excited.
Rebecca, when back at her room, downloaded immediately the code and installed on a newly created simple environment,
just a couple of servers.

## The Administrators are added
Then, using the default Admin credentials  which come with installation of BYOR, she set herself as administrator of the application,
specifying the userId and the password she is going to use
* Set administrator with userId "rebecca@smart.com" and pwd "rebecca".

Rebecca wants also James and Martina as additional administrators, so she adds them
* Set administrator with userId "james@smart.com" and pwd "james".
* Set administrator with userId "martina@smart.com" and pwd "martina".

## The first initiative is created
In the afternoon Rebecca calls James and Martina for a meeting to present them the BYOR app and discuss
of possible ways to leverage this new tool.
When they meet, that afternoon, the three quickly come to the agreement of creating an Initiative in BYOR
under which they will group all VotingEvents the SmartCompany will run. Consider that the SmartCompany belongs
to a Group and has other syster Companies. If one sister Company decides in future to use the the BYOR app,
she will be able to create a new Initiative using the same BYOR installation created by Rebecca.
So James logs in with his userid
* Login BYOR with user id "james@smart.com" and pwd "james"

Now, being him an Admin of BYOR, he creates the fist initiative.
Well, actually to be sure that nobody did it before him, he starts cancelling the initiative just in case and then creates it
* Cancel the initiative "FirstInitiativeForTheSmartCompany"
* Create the initiative "FirstInitiativeForTheSmartCompany"

and then James adds Rebecca and Martina as administrators of the initiative
* Add administrator "rebecca@smart.com" to initiative "FirstInitiativeForTheSmartCompany"
* Add administrator "martina@smart.com" to initiative "FirstInitiativeForTheSmartCompany"

## The first voting event is created
Two days later Rebecca, James and Martina meet again to decide which objectives they want to achieve with the BYOR  exercize
and how to structure the first voting event accordingly.
The first objective is to gather the most honest opinion from the IT population about the technologies they currently use
as well as the new ones that SmartCompany is considering for the next future.
Once such data is available, they want to open a structured discussion among the senior IT architects based on the exchange of comments
which will be registered in BYOR application.
Eventually, the architects will divide among themeselves the technologies, and for each of them will provide a final recommendation.
Therefore the first voting event will have to be structured in 3 steps:
Step1: an anonymous voting session, where all IT people will be invite to cast a vote along the 4 rings of the radar, for the
technologies subject to the poll - at the end of this step, the first version of the SmartCompany Tech Radar will be produced
Step2: a conversation among the IT architects will start - each architect will be able to log into BYOR, view the votes and the comments
and comments or respond to other comments
Step3: once this step starts, each architect will be able to log into the BYOR, choose the technologies for which it candidates to
provide the final recommendation, confirm or override the ring resulted from the open voting session run in step1 and log
the motivation for such choice.
BYOR allows configuring voting events with different steps, and each step can itself be configured to accommodate different methods
of authentication or other characteristics. The configuration can be defined in a file, with a specific JSON format.
Martina takes in charge to create the configuration file, "firstVotingEvent.smartCompany.json".
She logs in and then creates the voting event.
* Login BYOR with user id "martina@smart.com" and pwd "martina"
* Create "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" for "FirstInitiativeForTheSmartCompany" with config "firstVotingEvent.smartCompany.json"

Martina then adds Rebecca and James as administrators of the voting event just created
* Add "rebecca@smart.com" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Add "james@smart.com" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## Add technologies to the voting event and identify the architects who will take part in the discussion and final recommendation steps
By the end of the week, Martina and James prepare the list of the technologies they want to add to the voting event.
* Set technologies for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

Together with Rebecca they also prepare the list of the architects who will participate to the discussion step.
Some of them, the so called "champions", will also be the ones who will make the final recommendations.
* Load users for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## Open the voting event
Three weeks later all people from the IT department of SmartCompnay go to an event organized by Rebecca, James and Martina.
Rebecca opens the event explaining the initiative of the BYOR for SmartCompany and describes why all IT people are called to
participate to the voting session and are encouraged to cast their votes according to their experience.
Rebecca then opens the voting event
* Login BYOR with user id "rebecca@smart.com" and pwd "rebecca"
* Open the voting event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## People vote
The first one to vote is a developer whose nickname is "hare".
* "Hare" in "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" gives the votes 

   |technology |ring  |comment|tags             |
   |-----------|------|-------|-----------------|
   |Anemic REST|hold  |crap   |Prod Experience  |
   |Data Lake  |assess|sorta  |Personal Project |
   |Prettier   |trial |not bad|Training         |
   |Swagger    |adopt |good   |Blogs-Conferences|

Then votes a voter whose nickname is "Snail".
* "Snail" in "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" gives the votes 

   |technology |ring  |comment|tags             |
   |-----------|------|-------|-----------------|
   |Anemic REST|adopt |great  |Prod Experience  |

   |Prettier   |assess|well...|Training         |
   |Swagger    |hold  |baddd  |Blogs-Conferences|

Then a "Wise Man" votes.
* "Wise Man" in "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" gives the votes 

   |technology |ring |comment|tags            |

   |Prettier   |hold |STOPPP |Training        |
   |TypeScript |adopt|great  |Prod Experience |

## Some correct their first vote
After having saved its vote, "Snails" decides to add one technology, "GraphQL" which recently it used with success,
remove its vote for "Data Lake" since it does not have any experience and correct the vote on "Swagger" taking it from
"hold" to "assess".
* "Snail" corrects the vote in "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" 

   |technology |ring  |comment|tags           |
   |-----------|------|-------|---------------|
   |Anemic REST|adopt |great  |Prod Experience|
   |Prettier   |assess|well...|Training       |

   |GraphQL    |adopt |       |               |

## The first voting event is closed
The voting window lasts 30 minutes, after which Rebecca closes the voting event
* Login BYOR with user id "rebecca@smart.com" and pwd "rebecca"
* Close the voting event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## The results of the first round are shown
Now Rebecca can show the first version of the Radar, the one built from the votes of the IT people.
The Radar is diplayed using the BYOR official TW application invoked with specific parameters, and therefore√π
is out of the scope of this spec which is exclusively focused on the APIs exposed by the back end.
Via API though we can retrieve the votes
* Fetch the votes posted in "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
as well as the Blips
* Calculate the blips for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## The BYOR conversation among the architects starts
Rebecca, Martina and James designed the BYOR First Voting Event to have, after the initial voting round, a second step of conversation
among the architects of The Smart Company, to allow them add comments on specific technologiies and to respond to comments
posted by others.
This second step is restricted to Architect and Senior Architects as it has been defined in the `firstVotingEvent.smartCompany.json`
configuration file.
Architect and Senior Architect roles have been added to the relevant users in the file `users.csv`.
In the evening Martina moves the voting event to the second step.
* Login BYOR with user id "martina@smart.com" and pwd "martina"
* Move "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" to the next step in the flow
* Open the voting event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
While moving the voting event to the next step, the back end calculates the results of the voting session for each technology,
counting the votes per ring and per tag as well as counting the comments.

## One architect responds to a comment on a vote
Kent is the first one to login to the BYOR app. He first takes a glance to the list of technologies, the votes and the comments cast
for each of the technologies
* Login BYOR with user id "kent@smart.com" and pwd "kent" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* See all votes and comments for voting event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

Kent is curious to see what people said about "Data Lake" and decides to look at the details of the votes for Data lake.
* Look at the details of the votes for "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

Reading the comments he decides to respond to the comment of "Hare" who wrote 'sorta' as comment, while Kent is a fan of Data Lakes
* Respond "Data lakes are really great" to the first comment of "Hare"

## A second architect logs in and sees the reply to the comment
Alonzo, a Senior Architect at the SmartCompany logs in, open the details of Data Lake and sees the comment added by Kent.
* Login BYOR with user id "alonzo@smart.com" and pwd "alonzo" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Look at details of "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" after "kent@smart.com" added a reply to the comment in the vote of "Hare"

## An architect then adds a comment to a Technology
Alonzo wants also to leave a comment regarding "Git", which he thinks is a great tool. The comment is on the Technology and is not
related to any comment expressed by voters in their votes.
* Comment "This is really a great tool" for "Git"

## A second architect reads the comment on a technology and adds a reply
Later Alan, another architect, logs in, sees the comment from Alonzo on "Git" and adds a reply.
* Login BYOR with user id "alan@smart.com" and pwd "alan" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Look at details of "Git" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" after "alonzo@smart.com" added a comment
* Reply "I thing that with Git Linus really failed" to the comment of "alonzo@smart.com"

## A third architect logs in and sees the reply to the comment on a technology
In the evening Rebecca logs in again and sees the reply of Alan to the comment of Alonzo on "Git".
* Login BYOR with user id "rebecca@smart.com" and pwd "rebecca" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Look at details of "Git" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" after "alan@smart.com" replied to a comment on the technology

## The event is moved from the conversation step to the recommendation step
A week later, after few days the event was in the "conversation step", Rebecca and Martina decide it is time to move to the last step,
the "recommendation step", where the "champions" provide the final recommendation for each technology.
The "champions" are a subgroup of architects with specific seniority to take the responsibility of signing the final recommendation,
and this group is assigned to the users of BYOR app when the users are loaded, which happens during the configuration of the event.
Martina logs in and moves the voting event to the recommendation step
* Login BYOR with user id "martina@smart.com" and pwd "martina"
* Move "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" to the next step in the flow

## The first recommendation is saved
The first champion who logs in to enter a recommendation is Alonzo
* Login BYOR with user id "alonzo@smart.com" and pwd "alonzo" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
Alonzo has agreed with the other champions that he will finalize the recommendation of "Data Lake", so fetches the
details of such technology
* Look at the details of the votes for "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
To facilitate the work Alonzo wants to read also the previous Blips on this technology
* Fetch old blips for "Data Lake"
Alonzo now is ready to write the final recommendation for Data Lake and therefore set himself as the owner of such
final recommendation
* Signup for recommendation for "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
Then he writes the actual recommendation, stating that this is a good technology, and saves it
* Recommend "adopt" as ring for "Data Lake" because "This is really a cool tech" for event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"

## Another Champion tries to give a recommendation on a technology which has already a recommendation
Alan did not get that Alonzo volounteered to provide the recommendation on Data Lake. He would like to do it himself.
He logs into the system
* Login BYOR with user id "alan@smart.com" and pwd "alan" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
and tries to signup as author for the recommendation but with no success since Alonzo already gave his recommendation
* Try to signup for the recommendation of "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany" but the system does not allow

## The author of a recommendation cancels the recommendation and another Champion takes this task
Alan sees that Alonzo has already given the recommendation. He call then Alonzo and tell him that he would really like to
be the author of the recommendation for Data Lake.
Alonzo, who is a mature man, accepts. He logs into the system
* Login BYOR with user id "alonzo@smart.com" and pwd "alonzo" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
and then cancels his recommendation
* Cancel the recommendation for "Data Lake" in event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
Now Alan can actually login and set its own recommendation
* Login BYOR with user id "alan@smart.com" and pwd "alan" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Recommend "hold" as ring for "Data Lake" because "I, Alan, tried and did not work" for event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
In the evening Rebecca logs in and reads the recommendation from Alan
* Login BYOR with user id "rebecca@smart.com" and pwd "rebecca" for "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany"
* Read the recommendation of "alan@smart.com" for "Data Lake" for event "FirstVotingEventForTheSmartCompany": "hold" as ring and text "I, Alan, tried and did not work"
